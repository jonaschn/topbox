class STMT(object):
    """Stanford Topic Modelling Toolbox Wrapper.

    This is a wrapper Class around the Stanford Topic Modelling Toolbox. It
    assumes that you have your vector space in your code, and don't want to
    bother with the `csv -> scala -> java -> csv -> extract results` process.
    It therefore compresses all of this in a few class interactions. Basically,
    you create model by initiating it with a name, set the amount of epochs
    and memory as desired, and then start training and testing on data that
    you have in Python code. After, the class can handle extracting the correct
    results (even in sklearn format), as well as cleaning up once you're done.
    Some examples of this will be given below, more information can be found
    on https://cmry.github.io/notes/topbox.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : string
        The name that will be appended to all the saved files. If you want to
        keep the trained model, this name can be used to load it back in.

    epochs : integer, optional, default 20
        The amount of iterations you want L-LDA to train and sample; if you
        run into some errors, it's a good idea to set this to 1 to save time
        whilst debugging.

    mem : integer, optional, default 7000
        The amount of memory (in MB) that the model will use. By default it
        assumes that you have 8G of memory, so it will account for 1G of os
        running. Should be comfortable; adjust if running into OutOfMemory
        errors though.

    keep : boolean, optional, default True
        If set to False, will remove the data and scala files after training,
        and will remove EVERYTHING after the results are obtained. This can
        be handy when running a quick topic model and save disk space. If
        you're running a big model and want to keep it after your session is
        done, it might be better to just leave it to True.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dir : string
        Absolute path where the storage area of the topbox is located.

    Examples
    --------
    train = [['sports football', 'this talks about football, or soccer,
               with a goal and a ball'],
             ['sports rugby', 'here we have some document where we do a scrum
               and kick the ball'],
             ['music concerts', 'a venue with loud music and a stage'],
             ['music instruments', 'thing that have strings or keys, or
               whatever']]

    test = [['music', 'the stage was full of string things'],
            ['sports', 'we kick a ball around'],
            ['rugby', 'now add some confusing sentence with novel words what is
              happening']]
